## HTTP Request and Response: Step-by-Step Breakdown

This document outlines the detailed steps performed during the HTTP request and response simulation in the Networking Journey Simulator.

---

### 1. Start Logging and UI Update

- **Log Message**: `"ðŸ“¡ STAGE 3: HTTP REQUEST & RESPONSE"`
- **Purpose**: Indicate the beginning of the HTTP communication stage and update the visual panel accordingly.

---

### 2. Announce Sending the Request

- **Log Message**: `"ðŸ”„ Sending HTTP Request..."`
- **Purpose**: Notifies the simulation log that the request is about to be sent.

---

### 3. Create and Configure HTTP Connection

- **Parse** the provided URL.
- **Open** a `HttpURLConnection`.
- **Set properties**:
  - HTTP method: `GET`
  - Request Header: `User-Agent: NetworkingSimulator/1.0`
  - Timeouts: 5 seconds (connect and read)

---

### 4. Log Simulated HTTP Request Headers

- **Example Logged Headers**:
  - `GET / HTTP/1.1`
  - `Host: google.com`
  - `User-Agent: NetworkingSimulator/1.0`
  - (other standard headers)

---

### 5. Send Request and Measure Response Time

- Record `startTime` before sending the request.
- Retrieve the HTTP `responseCode`.
- Record `endTime` after receiving the response.
- Compute `RTT = endTime - startTime`.

---

### 6. Log HTTP Response Info

- **Status Code**: e.g., `200 OK`
- **Content-Type**: e.g., `text/html`
- **Content-Length**: actual byte size
- **Server**: e.g., `Apache`, `Nginx`
- **Response Time**: e.g., `87ms`

---

### 7. Handle Redirects (If Applicable)

- If response code is `3xx`, retrieve the `Location` header.
- **Log Message**: `"ðŸ”„ Redirect detected to: <new URL>"`

---

### 8. If Response is 200 (Success), Preview Content

- Open input stream from the server.
- Read the first 5 lines of the HTML content.
- Calculate total characters read.
- **Log Message**: e.g., `"ðŸ“„ Content preview: 348 characters read..."`
