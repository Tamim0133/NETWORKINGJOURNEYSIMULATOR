## TcpConnector Class Overview

The `TcpConnector` class simulates the process of establishing a TCP connection using the standard TCP 3-way handshake mechanism.

It visually and textually logs each handshake stage using a helper class called `SimulationUtils`.

## Limitations of Java's Socket API

While this simulation mimics the stages of TCP connection establishment, it does not provide access to low-level TCP flags (e.g., SYN, ACK) because Javaâ€™s `Socket` API operates at a higher level of abstraction.

### To Access Real TCP Packet-Level Information:

- Use a packet sniffer such as **Wireshark**
- Use a native networking library such as:
  - **Raw sockets in C**
  - **JNI (Java Native Interface)** to interface with lower-level networking APIs
